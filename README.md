# GoveeTwitchBot

This is an application that will allow for you to connect your Twitch Chat to your Govee Lights system. The Govee API only allows for 10 requests per minute, so I have set timers to cap this. If you only have one device getting requests, you can most likely remove this timer, but if you have 5-10 devices, then the timer is most likely necessary.

Create a config.js file and store you API keys and other info there and import to the Twitch Bot file.

Obviously, change all other info like client.say info and things of that nature.
